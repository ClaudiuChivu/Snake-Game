# Snake Game in Python

This is a classic Snake game built in Python using the `turtle` library for rendering and controlling the graphics. The goal of the game is to control a snake that moves across the screen to eat food (red dots), thus increasing the snake's length and score. You must avoid collisions with the screen edges, obstacles (gray blocks), and the snake's own body.

## Features:
- Control the snake using the **W, A, S, D** keys.
- New segments are added to the snake as it eats food.
- Obstacles (gray blocks) that can cause you to lose the game.
- Track your score and high score.
